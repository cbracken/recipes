Vegan Crêpes
============

Makes 15 crêpes.

Ingredients
-----------
* 125 mL soy milk
* 125 mL water
* 60g vegan margarine
* 15g sugar
* 30 mL maple syrup
* 130g flour
* pinch salt (to taste)

Directions
----------
1. Combine flour, salt, and sugar in a medium-sized mixing bowl.
1. Melt margarine at low temperature. Mix with soy milk, water, and maple syrup.
   Add to dry ingredients and mix until smooth.
1. Refrigerate for 2 hours.
1. Heat crêpe pan, melt a small amount of margarine. Add 50 mL batter, swirl to
   spread thinly over pan, cook until golden, flip and finish.

Notes
-----
* This recipe tends to come out a bit crispy. For a dairy-free non-vegan crêpe,
  adding an egg should fix this.
