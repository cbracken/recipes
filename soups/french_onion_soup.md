Notes
-----
* Sweet onion: mellow and sweet, with a brightness right at the end.
* Red onion: deeper flavour with a slightly bitter edge and less sweetness.
* Yellow onion: lots of bright flavour, very mild bitterness, and a sweetness
  backing it up.
* Shallot: really good balance of sweetness with both bright flavours and deep,
  rich ones, and just a hint of bitterness.

Mixing them together seems to produce the best flavour of all.
